# The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

# Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
# Note:
# 0 â‰¤ x, y < 2**31

    while x > 0 or y > 0:

        count += (x%2) ^ (y%2)
        # bit shifts x and y one to the right
        x >>= 1
        y >>= 1
