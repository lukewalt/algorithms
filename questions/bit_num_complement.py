# Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

# Example 1:
# Input: 5
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

# Example 2:
# Input: 1
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

# Note:
# The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
# You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
